_"[Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/) is a toolkit for building data integration and real-time data processing pipelines."_

_"Pipelines consist of Spring Boot apps, built using the Spring Cloud Stream or Spring Cloud Task microservice frameworks. This makes Spring Cloud Data Flow suitable for a range of data processing use cases, from import/export to event streaming and predictive analytics."_

Spring Cloud Data Flow allows us to build apps to process the data streams in real time using message queues like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ. The added benefit of the data in a message queue means that we can have different apps subscribed to the topic to product different results. 

Another benefit is the fact that we can design, new pipelines for data without an easy to use UI interface as well us not having to restart already existing pipelines.
